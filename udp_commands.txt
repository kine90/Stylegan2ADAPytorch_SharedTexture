UDP COMMANDS SHOULD BE FORMATTED AS UTF-8 STRINGS. NUMBERS MUST BE INTEGRERS

Commands for "generate_receiveZ_v2"
------------------------------------

TRONCATIPN PSI (Reccomended values 1.0 - 2)
    trunc_{(VALUE + 5) * 200}

    This parameter comes from stylegan 2 code. It sort of defines how "weird" generated pictures will be.
    #EXAMPLE
    To set value 1.2 send the following string
    "trunc_1240"

W INTERPOLATION
    wint_{VALUE * 2000}

    This is a float in range 0 - 1, defines how much the new w_samples will be blended with the previous one
    #EXAMPLE
        To set value 0.25 send the following string
        "wint_500"

AMPLITUDE (Should work around 3, but feel free to experiment)
    amplitude_{VALUE}

    Defines the scale to apply when converting the latent from spout to float noise
    #EXAMPLE
        "amplitude_5"

NOISEMODE
    noisemode_{SELECTION AS INT}

    Possible values:
        0 - Constant
        1 - Random
        2 - None
    This par. comes from Stylegan.
    #EXAMPLE
        To set Random, send:
        "noisemode_1"


TERMINATE
    terminate_1

    Nicely terminates python processes.
    #EXAMPLE
        "terminate_1"

SEED
    seed_{VALUE}

    Defines the random seed for the next latent
    #EXAMPLE
        To generate image for seed 1472, send
        "seed_1472"

TRONCATIPN PSI (Reccomended values 1.0 - 2)
    trunc_{(VALUE + 5) * 200}

    This parameters comes from stylegan 2 code. It sort of defines how "weird" generated pictures will be.
    #EXAMPLE
    To set value 1.2 send the following string
    "trunc_1240"

Z INTERPOLATION
    zint_{VALUE * 2000}

    This is a float in range 0 - 1, defines how much the new generation seed will be blended with the previous one
    #EXAMPLE
        To set value 0.25 send the following string
        "zint_500"

W INTERPOLATION
    wint_{VALUE * 2000}

    This is a float in range 0 - 1, defines how much the new w_samples will be blended with the previous one
    #EXAMPLE
        To set value 0.25 send the following string
        "wint_500"


NOISEMODE
    noisemode_{SELECTION AS INT}

    Possible values:
        0 - Constant
        1 - Random
        2 - None
    This par. comes from Stylegan.
    #EXAMPLE
        To set Random, send:
        "noisemode_1"


TERMINATE
    terminate_1

    Nicely terminates python processes.
    #EXAMPLE
        "terminate_1"
